    FORTNITE ON CHROMEBOOK
    <br>
    A bit harder than you think. First unblock your chromebook using the Unblock Chromebook button. Need help? Ask me IRL.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Method 1 - Nvidia (PC CONTROLS)</h1>
    After, visit <a target="_blank" href="https://play.geforcenow.com">geforcenow</a> and sign in (Make an account if you dont have one - do NOT use a school email account).<br>
    After this it may ask you to link accounts, or once you visit the home page there should be a button to.<br>
    Click this button or go to the link accounts page and link your Epic Games account <b>Make one if you dont have one - you should if you play fortnite</b><br><br>
    Go to the home page, click fortnite, and play. The load times can be slow at times, but if you get down to like #70-#80 you will be on in no time.
    <br>
    <h1>Method 2 - XBOX</h1>
    <b>Better wait times? YES! Need a controller or phone? Also.. yes.</b><br><br>
    Visit <a href="https://xbox.com/play">xbox.com</a> and sign in (Make an account if you dont have one - do NOT use a school email account).<br>
    After this select fortnite<br>
    <b>Make sure you have a controller ready if you are on chromebook. Plug it in or bluetooth it before you hit play on fortnite.</b><br>
    Boom! Hit play and load in.<br>
    Once in game it gives you an <b><i>option</i></b> to link accounts. This isnt required.<br><br>
    Want to play on Phone (ios) even though its not on the store? Sure!<br>

    Go to xbox.com/play on Safari. Click share and add to home screen.<br>
    Then open the newly installed app and sign in. Click fortnite and play.<br>
    Boom! Touch controls.
